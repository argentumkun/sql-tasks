Select customers with no region (null in the Region field) to be at the end, instead of at the top,
where youâ€™d normally find the null values. Within the same region, companies should be sorted by CustomerID.
As a hint you can create a field with the Case statement, which allows you do to if/then logic.
You want a field that is 1 when Region is null.
